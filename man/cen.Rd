\title{A dataset ready to use with CENTIPEDE.}
\format{A list with two items:
\describe{
  \item{mat}{A numeric matrix with counts of read start sites.
   Each row corresponds to a genomic site flanked by 100 bp. A single row
   contains information about the positive strand and the negative strand.
   So, for example, this dataset uses a transcription factor motif of length
   13 bp and flanks of length 100 bp. Therefore, the matrix has
   2 * (100 + 13 + 100) = 426 columns.
  }
  \item{regions}{A dataframe.
   Each row corresponds to a genomic site, in the same order as the
   matrix of counts. This has information from a run of FIMO using the 13 bp
   motif for STAT4.
